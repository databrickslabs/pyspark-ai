{"key": "\nGiven a PySpark dataframe with the following schema:\n\n```\nid: bigint\n```\n\nWrite a Python function called `transform_df` with the input parameter `df` of the type DataFrame that performs the\nfollowing transformation and returns a new dataframe: Show the sum of id\n\nIn addition the generated code must follow adhere to the following requirements:\n\n  * The answer code MUST contain one function only.\n  * The answer must not contain code outside of the function definition (except imports).\n  * The generated code MUST NOT call the generated function.\n  * The generated code must not create or use a SparSession but only use the input `df` variable.\n\nEnsure your answer is correct.\n", "value": "Here is the Python function `transform_df` that performs the required transformation:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import sum\n\ndef transform_df(df):\n    return df.agg(sum(\"id\").alias(\"sum_id\"))\n```\n\nThis function uses the `sum` function from the `pyspark.sql.functions` module to calculate the sum of the `id` column in the input dataframe `df`. It then renames the sum column to \"sum_id\" using the `alias` method. The result is returned as a new dataframe.\n\nNote that this function adheres to all the given requirements, including being a single function, not containing code outside of the function definition, not calling the generated function, and not creating or using a SparkSession."}
